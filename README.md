## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Python Backend Setup

1. **Create the backend files:**
```bash
mkdir carbon-marketplace
cd carbon-marketplace
mkdir backend
cd backend
```

2. **Save the Python code** as `app.py` (copy from the Python artifact above)

3. **Create requirements.txt:**
```txt
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
```

4. **Install and run:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
‚úÖ Backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 2: React Frontend Setup

1. **Create React app:**
```bash
cd ..
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
```

2. **Install additional dependencies:**
```bash
npm install recharts lucide-react
```

3. **Replace src/App.js** with the React code (copy from React artifact above)

4. **Update src/App.css** (add Tailwind-like styles):
```css
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css');

.line-clamp-3 {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

5. **Run frontend:**
```bash
npm start
```
‚úÖ Frontend will open at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîß Alternative Setup (No Installation Required)

### Option 1: Single HTML File
Save the original HTML artifact as `carbon-marketplace.html` and open in browser - works immediately!

### Option 2: Online Development
- **Backend**: Deploy on Railway, Heroku, or PythonAnywhere
- **Frontend**: Deploy on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages

## üìä How to Use the Platform

### For Individual Learning (10-15 minutes)

1. **Start as GreenCorp Inc.**
   - Browse marketplace to see 9 different carbon offset projects
   - Notice project types: Forestry, Renewable Energy, Waste Management, etc.
   - Check prices ranging from $28.90 to $65.80 per tCO‚ÇÇ

2. **Make Your First Purchase**
   - Go to "Marketplace" tab
   - Click "Buy for $X" on Amazon Reforestation project
   - Adjust quantity (try 10 credits = $425)
   - Confirm purchase - see balance decrease

3. **Check Your Portfolio**
   - Switch to "Portfolio" tab
   - See your holdings, current value, and performance
   - Notice the different project types in your portfolio

4. **Retire Credits for Impact**
   - In portfolio, click "Retire 5 Credits"
   - See retired credits count increase
   - This represents actual CO‚ÇÇ offset (5 tons removed from atmosphere)

5. **Switch Users & Compare**
   - Change user dropdown to "EcoStart Ltd."
   - Notice different balance and portfolio
   - Each company has different strategies and budgets

### For Team Simulation (30-60 minutes)

#### **Scenario 1: Corporate Carbon Compliance**
```
Roles:
- Team A: Large Corporation (GreenCorp Inc.) - Budget: $100,000
- Team B: Tech Startup (EcoStart Ltd.) - Budget: $50,000  
- Team C: Manufacturing (Sustainable Dynamics) - Budget: $75,000

Goal: Achieve 100 tCO‚ÇÇ offset within budget
Strategy: Different teams can focus on different project types
```

#### **Scenario 2: Market Making Exercise**
```
Roles:
- Project Developers: Manage 3 projects each, set competitive prices
- Corporate Buyers: Purchase credits to meet sustainability targets
- Traders: Buy low, sell high to make profit

Duration: 45 minutes trading session
Success Metrics: Total volume traded, price efficiency
```

#### **Scenario 3: Impact Investment Challenge**
```
Constraint: Each team must achieve maximum CO‚ÇÇ offset per dollar
Evaluation Criteria:
- Cost per ton of CO‚ÇÇ offset
- Portfolio diversification (different project types)
- Geographic spread of projects
- Verification standard quality (VCS, Gold Standard, etc.)
```

### Advanced Analytics & Learning

1. **Market Analysis**
   - Go to "Analytics" tab
   - Study price differences between project types
   - Renewable Energy: Usually $35-45/tCO‚ÇÇ
   - Forestry Projects: $30-45/tCO‚ÇÇ
   - Nature-based Solutions: $50-70/tCO‚ÇÇ (premium for co-benefits)

2. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Diversify across verification standards
   - Balance cost vs. impact
   - Consider geographic and technology risk

3. **Real-World Connection**
   - Prices reflect actual carbon market conditions
   - Project types mirror real carbon offset categories
   - Verification standards are actual industry certifications
